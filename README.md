# Dudley Utility Services — Brand & Design System

The complete DUS brand system, packaged so anyone at Dudley can generate on-brand assets with Claude: social posts, LinkedIn covers (company and personal), carousels, presentation decks, one-pagers, letterhead, and proposals.

You describe the content. The system owns how it looks.

## Start here

**Open the brand book:** download or clone this repo and open `dus-brand/index.html` in a browser. It shows the whole system: logo rules, color, type, motifs, components, and live previews of every template.

**Set up Claude (one time):** follow `dus-brand/README-FOR-DUS.md`. Three paths, pick one:

| You use… | Setup |
|---|---|
| Claude.ai with Skills | Zip the `dus-brand` folder (or grab the zip from the latest [Release](../../releases)) and upload it under Settings → Capabilities → Skills |
| A shared Claude Project | Paste `dus-brand/PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` into the Project instructions and upload the `dus-brand` files as knowledge |
| Claude Cowork / Claude Code | Point your session at the `dus-brand` folder |

Then just ask: *"Make a LinkedIn post announcing our new Director of Operations"* or *"Draft a proposal for [Client] for ROW acquisition, 4 phases."*

## Ground rules

- Colors: **DUS Teal `#015270`** (primary), **Dudley Green `#41BE48`** (accent, sparingly), ink, gray, white. Nothing else.
- Type: **Lato**, three weights. The DUDLEY wordmark is artwork, never re-typed.
- The signature motif is the **route alignment**: a surveyor's dash-dot centerline with easement corridor, PI monuments, and station ticks, over a plat-style survey grid.
- No emoji, no hype words, no invented numbers. Approved standing claims: 45+ years of energy-land expertise; licensed in roughly 38 states.
- Voice is canonical in `dus-brand/reference/voice.md`. DUS never reads as new, never names a client, and never mentions renewables.

## Making changes

The templates are locked by design — consistency is the product. If something needs to evolve (new template, new claim, contact block updates), change it here and cut a new release so every copy stays in sync. Maintained with the Benali team.
